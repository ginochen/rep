# Project for Uber trips
# Summary
- Stay close to SF downtown any time. SF downtown has the highest density of pickups. 
- Best weekdays time recommendation of any location is rush hour times (7-9am, 16-19pm).
- Weekends SF area are generally low on pickups, so if the driver is desperate, maybe focus on the highest yield times (4-6am) and take a break for the weekend.
- Weekdays and weekends stategies:
  - During weekdays, stay close to SF downtown.
  - During weekends, stay close to outskirt of SF downtown around 6am, 16, 17pm, and SF downtown for other times. 

Otherthings to keep in mind:
- The commission from Uber barely changes from 20\%.
